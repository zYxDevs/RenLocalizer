"""
Regression tests for dialogue that continues on the next physical line (v2.8.17).

Ren'Py lets a plain string span physical lines:

    ply "I'm just disgusted with such a man. When he had a beautiful woman beside him,
        but instead he made out with another woman! Tch, it makes me sick."

Its lexer reads that as one string and collapses the newline plus the
continuation's indentation into a single space. The parser only knew the
triple-quoted form, so the opening line matched no pattern and the entire line
of dialogue was dropped — 325 lines in FunTanariZ 1.12 alone.
