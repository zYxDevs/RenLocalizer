"""
Regression tests for Ren'Py's global `old "..."` uniqueness rule (v2.8.17).

Ren'Py keys string translations globally, not per file:

    Exception: A translation for "KYAHHHHHHHHHH!!" already exists at
    game/tl/turkish/SCRIPTS/MC/Hatake Yurika/hayu gallery.rpy:1156.

Reported against FunTanariZ 1.12. The same shouted line appeared in two
scripts; both were spoken by a multi-speaker/engine-code speaker, so native
TLID generation demoted each of them to a string entry — and that demotion ran
per file, after the pipeline's global dedup, which lets dialogue through by
location on purpose (multi-branch support).
